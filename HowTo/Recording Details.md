# Recording your character details
## Stats

The stats data is stored in a table and there are links to the Dice Roller to let you roll a D6 plus your stat value.

Enter the value for each stat in the `Value` column and then replace the value in the Dice Roller command with the value of your character's stat. The table has been given a 'name' so that we can embed it in the master character sheet. The caret symbol tells Obsidian that the preceding block has a name and can be linked to. 

You may also notice the data at the top of the page. That is called 'frontmatter' and it is a form of metadata that you can use to describe the page and also to set variables that other plugins can access. You won't use it now but to future-proof the Vault your should probably enter your stat values now. 

## Vows
Once you have determined your initial Vows you can edit the [[_Vows]] file. There is a space for the name of the Vow and a bar to track the progress. If you want to add more rows there is a `Vow Table Row` template you can use. Both the Vow and Progress Notes have a link to the [[Task difficulty]] table if you need to refer to it.

## Progress
The Progress tracks work in a similar way to the Vows except that they are not included in the main character sheet. There is a `Progress Task Row` template that you can use to insert new progress tracks as you need them. 

## Assets
The [[_Assets|Assets]] file Is where you will store the details for any Assets that your character has. There is an [[Assets]] file in the rules that has all of the available Assets in the game and you can choose yours from there and copy them int the [[_Assets|Assets]] file. This will then be included in your character sheet. 

Once you have you character completed you can explore some of [[Further options| the other options]] that you can use to make notes about the campaign and your world.
