# Using Panes
A small warning before we walk through the process of creating multiple panes. The **Obsidian Tabs** plugin changes the way that Obsidian works such that splitting panes is not possible. It will not let you set up a Dashboard as will be discussed in this Note. 

The data in this Vault has been broken down into smaller components for two purposes. It makes it easier to edit those documents (and makes it less likely that you'll mess up an entire character with a wayward edit) but primarily it is to allow you to create a Dashboard for your character and campaign that lets you easily see all of your data at once.

## Where to start
Probably the easiest place to start with would be your Character. So open that. Once it is open you can use two options in the _More Options_ menu to split the page vertically and horizontally to add new panes.

If you split your character horizontally you will then have two view of the document. Each new Pane contains the original document prior to being split. If you click into a Pane it becomes active and you can then split it further. Click into the topmost pane and use the _Split vertically_ command twice. This is what you should have.

Now when you have a Pane active you can click on a Note in the file sidebar and it will then be displayed in the active pane. You can do this to add your Stats, Tracks and Vows to the three topmost panes.

How you arrange your Panes and how many you have will depend on what you need during your game and how big your screen is. Each pane can also be put into edit mode to edit them and the mode of each pane is not dependent on the other panes so you can have a Note in one pane that you are editing to add session notes while the others are in Reading mode to let you view the data. 

Finally lets talk about some of [[Other files|the other files]] in this Vault and how you may want to use them.
