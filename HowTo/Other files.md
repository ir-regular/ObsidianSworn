# Other files
## Read_me
There is a Read Me file at the root of the Vault which is there as it is typical when putting files up on Github. It has some brief notes and links to the [[Getting Started]] Note. It isn't used as part of Ironsworn games.

## Dice and Home
At the root of the Vault are two files, [[Dice]] and [[Home]].  Home is primarily blank with suggestions about what you can add to them. The Dice page has some basic Dice Rollers in it that you can add to a Pane in your dashboard to let you roll dice in Obsidian while you play. The [Dice Roller documentation](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller#readme) has many examples of different dice you can roll and different options you can use. If you add those rollers, or links to them, in the Dice page then you can access them anywhere in your Vault.

## Rules
The Rules directory has Markdown files for [[Assets]], [[Moves]], [[Oracles]] and associated details for the Delve rules in their own directory. I don't currently own the Delve rules so I have not expanded the use of those files in this Vault. These are all taken from Discord user **@rsek's** [Datasworn](https://github.com/rsek/datasworn) archive. 

Since all of that data is in Markdown format you can copy it from the rules docs and then paste it where-ever you want to access it. You can even [link to](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Link+to+blocks) or embed a specific block in those files. For example this code:

`![[Moves#Heal]]`

will embed the Heal Move

![[Moves#Heal]]

So Obsidian not only lets you track notes and content but it can also let you use that content in very powerful ways. 

## Sessions
There is a Sessions directory for you to store any notes you have about your game sessions. There isn't any templates or default files for this as section as it seems to be a very personal and particular type of data to track.
