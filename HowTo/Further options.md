# Further options
There are several things that you can do to expand how you use Obsidian to track your campaign. 

## Learning Markdown
Obsidian uses Markdown to let you create HTML. The intent of Markdown is that it lets you format text which will later be rendered or viewed as HTML data. The beauty of this is that you can quickly take notes while you play and still have attractive looking data when you read it later or even export it to post elsewhere.

The two best places to start are the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) Guide and the [Obsidian formatting page](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes). The best thing about Markdown is that it is easy to learn and easy to fix your mistakes. It is rather newbie-friendly in that regard.

## Writing about the world
There are several directories in this Vault that you can use to store notes about your campaign and World. The Almanac directory has three subdirectories, Monsters, NPCs and Places, that you can use to store notes. Once you have a note written it is very easy to link to it in other documents.

### Linking
Obsidian uses a style of links called Wikilinks. These are a file name between an opening and closing set of square brackets.

`[[Further options]]`

When you start typing the first set of square brackets `[[` Obsidian will pop up a dialog that shows you the notes in your Vault and allow you to select a Note to link to.

And you can start to type a filename and Obsidian will filter the files listed to match what you are typing. Select the file and hit return and Obsidian will insert the link for you. The Obsidian Help site has more information [about how to create links](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Internal+link). 

### Embedding
You can also embed a Note in another note by adding an  `!` to the beginning of your link.  This link:

`![[Harm and Stress]]`

will embed the Harm and Stress table into a document like so:

![[Harm and Stress]]

So if you want to make a Note that has the details of all of your NPCs you could embed them all into a single Note and then display that. 

## The World
This Vault includes a Note that has [[World| the World checklist]] from the core rules. You can go through that checklist and then copy the options you selected to the `_World` Note in the Almanac so you can view or embed only the data that is useful to your campaign. 

Once you have data in a Note there are many ways for you to access and display that data in Obsidian but during a game session it is often useful to create a Dashboard in Obsidian by splitting the display into [[Panes|multiple Panes]].
