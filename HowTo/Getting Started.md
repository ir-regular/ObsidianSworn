# Getting Started
These files are a custom Obsidian Vault created to help gamers track their character data for the [Ironsworn RPG](https://www.ironswornrpg.com).  If you haven't used it before, Obsidian is a note taking and tracking application that uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) to write and display notes. Markdown is a format deisgned to make it easier to write HTML data. You can quickly and easily format your text without having to use HTML tags. Obsidian also makes it easy for you to link to and even embed other pages in your Vault. 
Each Obsidian Vault has its own settings and styles so anything that you enable to use this Vault will [not affect any of your other Vaults](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+multiple+vaults).  If you haven't used Markdown before the Obsidian Help site has a good starting point for [learning the basics of Markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes). 

## Credits
This Vault is based on the work of Discord member **@rumorsmatrix** who posted a version of his ongoing campaign Vault based on feedback from myself and other members on the [Ironsworn Discord](https://discord.gg/2abGCzuk4j). I have finessed his original Vault and added a few features that I thought would be useful. 

## Plugins
This Ironsworn RPG Vault requires the use of two Obsidian plugins. You should enable them before accessing any of the files in the Vault.

### Templates 
This plugin is part of the Obsidian Core Plugins but is not enabled by default. To enable it open  Settings - Core Plugins and then scroll down to **Templates**.  Enable the plugin. In order to use the provided templates, and make your own, you will need to select the template directory. Once it has been enabled there is an Options button. Click it and then, in the dialog, click in the *Template Folder Location* field. Obsidian will autofill it with a list of the directories in Vault. Select the *Templates* directory. While you are ther you can change the date and time formats if you want.  The Obsidian Help pages have [more information about using Templates](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates). 

### Dice Roller
Many files in this Vault use the [Dice Roller plugin](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller). The easiest way to load it is to first enable *Community Plugins* in Settings -  Community Plugins. Check the *Safe Mode* field to **Off**. You will then need to click on the *Turn Safe Mode Off* button in the resulting dialog. The plugins being used in this Vault are very popular and widely used. If you feel like being more secure you can use the link above to check out the source code on Github. 

With Community Plugins enabled you can click the *Browse* button and then from the dialog enter *Dice Roller* in the search field. At this time there is only one Dice Roller plugin. Click *Install* and then once the plugin has been downloaded click the *Enable* button. 

The Dice Roller has a few useful options but you won't need to access those at the moment. The Dice Roller Github pages have more information on [how to use the plugin](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller#dice-roller) and add your own dice rolls. 

## CSS styles
The Ironsworn Vault uses a few pieces of custom CSS that change some of the default styles in Obsidian to make them more applicable to the Ironsworn RPG. One example of this are the Check Boxes used to select options for Assets. This CSS won't be enabled by default and you will need to do so. Go to Settings - Appearance and click on the *Manage* button. Next to the Default Obsidian theme should be an Ironsworn theme. Click on the *Use* button to enable the styles. Please note, some of the styles are only visible in the Reading mode and not editing mode. 
Currently the Ironsworn.css file foes the following:
* Changes the checkbox formatting so the text following it is Bold instead of having a strikethrough. This only shows in Reading mode
* The filenames are not displayed when embedding other Notes

## Next step
Once you have finished these steps you are now ready to [[Adding a Character|add a character]].
