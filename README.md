# ObsidianSworn
This is a Vault for the [Obsidian knowledge base](https://obsidian.md) that contains notes and other files that will be helpful when playing the [Ironsworn RPG](https://www.ironswornrpg.com).  

This is a basic Vault that will be expanded with further options. Check out [the author's blog](https://zacgaming.wordpress.com/tag/obsidian/) for articles on how to expand this Vault.

If this is your first time using Obsidian then you may want to check out the [[Getting Started]] article. 

## Credits
This Vault is based on the work of Discord member **@rumorsmatrix** who posted a version of his ongoing campaign Vault based on feedback from myself and other members on the [Ironsworn Discord](https://discord.gg/2abGCzuk4j). I have finessed his original Vault and added a few features that I thought would be useful. 

This Vault also uses Ironsworn rules data created by Discord user **@rsek's** and available in their[Datasworn](https://github.com/rsek/datasworn) archive. 

## Using the Vault

The quickest way to get started using this Vault is to download it as a Zip file.
