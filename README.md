# ObsidianSworn
This is a Vault for the [Obsidian knowledge base](https://obsidian.md) that contains notes and other files that will be helpful when playing the [Ironsworn RPG](https://www.ironswornrpg.com).  

This is a basic Vault that will be expanded with further options. Check out [the author's blog](https://zacgaming.wordpress.com/tag/obsidian/) for articles on how to expand this Vault.

If this is your first time using Obsidian then you may want to check out the [[Getting Started]] article.
